# Examples
There are a variety of single-spa example repositories, each for different use cases:
- [single-spa-examples](https://github.com/CanopyTax/single-spa-examples) is where you can find a large example showcasing what single-spa can do. You can also visit the [live demo](http://single-spa.surge.sh) for single-spa-examples.
- [simple-single-spa-webpack-example](https://github.com/joeldenning/simple-single-spa-webpack-example) is a small, simple example that can be used as a webpack starter.
- [single-spa-angular-cli-examples](https://github.com/PlaceMe-SAS/single-spa-angular-cli-examples) is an example of multiple angular apps coexisting in the same single page application. Each uses angular-cli to build a bundle lazily loaded by single-spa.
- [single-spa-es5-angularjs](https://github.com/joeldenning/single-spa-es5-angularjs) is a very tiny es5 example with angularjs.
